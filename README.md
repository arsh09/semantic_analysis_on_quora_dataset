# Introduction 

This is a semester project for a course, Social Media Mining and Graph Theory. 

For this project, I used the Quora Questions pairs dataset which is labelled as 1, if the questions are similar and 0 for dissimilar questions.

For all the neccessary files, please download the following trained models from my google drive: 

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t9GFxjRq-b0um3vseA8N2QDSi-U8lRPe

and place them under 'script' folders or otherwise change the files location in code. 


# How to run:

If you need to just run and test the GUI, place each files under script folder and run the GUI.py which will pop up a UI and you 
can test if two questions are similar or not, by entering each questions (or sentences) in the relevent field, selecting a classifier 
and then pressing the Get Prediction button. 


For a more in depth training, please have a look at image-01.png in the repo or my project presentation (filename: Question Similarity Presentation.pptx )
