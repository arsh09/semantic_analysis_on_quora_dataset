Depending on the use of this code, one can either use it to only predict
the semantic & syntatic equivalence or one can start training their own word2vec model and 
then train a classifier and then use it. For the former case, do the following steps.

1- Run the GUI.py file. 
2- A GUI will open up. Copy paste the two questions and select a classifier
3- Press 'Get Prediction' button to get the predictions.
4- Notice the results along with Metircs for each classifier prediction.


For the latter case, I will be explaining the code a bit and their purpose in 
the final presentation.
